The project is a website that can access certain AWS services, with some of its features. There are seperate py files for a few of the services like ec2, s3, dynamoDB which are connected using Boto API. The routes or the backend files have only been created for the ec2 service. And the frontend has been implemented using bootstrap. When clicking on the button of a service on the home it takes us to create an instance and later we see the list of instances with some of its attributes and can be stopped,terminated or started.
